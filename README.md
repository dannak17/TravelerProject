# Mexico Magico

Magical Mexico is a simple front-end project developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript following the BEM methodology and camelCase naming convention.

The project simulates a traveler's profile page, where users can:
-Edit their profile information (name and biograpy).
-Add new travel destinations with title and image.
-View places in a gallery with interactive like and delete buttons.
-Open a full-screen modal to preview images.
